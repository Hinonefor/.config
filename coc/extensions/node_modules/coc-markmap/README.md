# coc-markmap

Visualize your Markdown as mindmaps with [Markmap](https://github.com/dundalek/markmap).

This is an extension for [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).

If you prefer a CLI version, see [markmap-cli](https://github.com/gera2ld/markmap-cli).

Note: *coc-markmap* allows generating markmaps from current buffer or selected text, while the CLI version can only create markmaps from Markdown files.

## Installation

First, make sure [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) is started.

Then install with the Vim command:

```
:CocInstall coc-markmap
```

## Usage

Open a Markdown, and execute:

```viml
:CocCommand markmap.create
```

An HTML file with the same basename as the Markdown file will be created and opened in your default browser.

Visualization of selected text is also supported.

## Configurations

### Key mappings

There is no default key mapping, but you can easily add your own:

```viml
" Create markmap from the whole file
nmap <Leader>m <Plug>(coc-markmap-create)
" Create markmap from the selected lines
vmap <Leader>m <Plug>(coc-markmap-create-v)
```

### Commands

It is also possible to add a command to create markmaps.

```viml
command! -range=% Markmap CocCommand markmap.create <line1> <line2>
```

Now you have the `:Markmap` command to create a Markmap, either from the whole file or selected lines.
